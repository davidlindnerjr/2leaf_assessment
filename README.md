# 2Leaf Assessment

Hello hello! Welcome to my web dev assessment!

## Project Description

- The project is built using the React framework with a Firebase backend.
- Styled with plain css.
- Although frowned upon, Bootstrap rows and columns are used to enable a more seemless mobile responsive experience. I thought it would be better to use my time to implement as many features as prescirbed instead of re-learning and brushing up on flexbox. That is something that if time permitted I would go in and refactor to use flexbox.
- Sticky modal and hero carousel are implemented using jQuery. Though this is a React app, I wanted to display some jQuery techniques to display my knowledge in that realm.
- The project is hosted on GitHub and deployed using Firebase.

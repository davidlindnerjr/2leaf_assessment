                        Play to learn, play to practice, and you will win when you 
                        play in games. Remember how much fun you had growing up when 
                        you used to just go outside and play with your friends? We 
                        advocate using the "compete to learn" approach to practice--it 
                        lets kids play and have fun while competing. This type of practice, 
                        using competitive drills, does a better job of preparing players 
                        to compete in real games. Technically, this is called transference. 
                        What you do in practice carries over into what you do in games.

                        Want to improve your team's ball handling? Games like dribble knockout 
                        are very popular. Every player must have his or her own basketball. 
                        Coach starts the game. Every player must dribble constantly, stay 
                        in-bounds and try to knock the ball away from all other players in 
                        the game. Lose control of your basketball or go out-of-bounds, and you're 
                        eliminated. Boundaries for 10-12 players could start as half the court. 
                        After several players are eliminated, the boundary is reduced to only 
                        inside the 3-point area. Boundary is reduced again to the free-throw 
                        lane. Finally, when there are just two players left, they play the "finals" 
                        in the free throw half circle.
